To run example correctly you MUST use the following Java agent:

-javaagent:../javaflow.instrument-cdi-proxy.jar

It instruments OpenWebBeans generated proxies to work correctly with continuations!
First (by order) agent (-javaagent:../javaflow.instrument-continuations.jar) is only necessary if you are using Java 8 lambdas, or instrument classes at run-time
